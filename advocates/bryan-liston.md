## Bio

I've had my head in the clouds for over 5 years. Most of that time has been spent in operations, automation, software development and advocacy. I love helping improve products to make developers lives easier. Prior to Microsoft I worked at AWS as an Operations Manager, Engineer, Solutions Architect, and Developer Advocate. I've been doing Linux/DevOps-related work for the past 15 years in some form or another, developing software and architecting systems/infrastructure. I have a passion for supporting open source software and communities.
