  ## Bio
  My focus area is game development and emerging technologies.  I have worked for Microsoft in these areas since 2005.  My work has included helping our game developer partners port titles like Candy Crush, Alto's Adventure, Subway Surfers, and Monument Valley to Windows and Windows Phone, building projects that showcase new technologies for [Coding4Fun](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/) and [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/), writing C++ and gamedev docs for [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/), and speaking at various conferences such as BUILD, Unite, VSLive, and more.

  I'm probably best known for my [.NET Wiimote library](http://github.com/BrianPeek/WiimoteLib), but I have also created a [pile of other projects and articles](https://brianpeek.com/projects/), worked on the original Kinect for Windows SDK, the Microsoft Mustang ([Project Detroit](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/Project-Detroit-An-Overview)), [BoxingBots](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/projects/BoxingBots), and the [LEGO EV3 Sentry Bot](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/BUILD-Conference-Highlights/Lego). I also co-authored two books: "[Coding4Fun: 10 .NET Programming Projects for Wiimote, YouTube, World of Warcraft, and More](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005SN8BCS/)" and "[Debugging ASP.NET](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735711410/)".

  I have self-published or dabbled in building modern and retro gamedev projects on PC, iOS, Android, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Dreamcast, Neo Geo Pocket, Atari Lynx, Gameboy, Apple II(gs), and more.  When I'm not working, you'll find me restoring the pinballs in my garage, playing a game, or working on yet another gamedev or emulation project.
