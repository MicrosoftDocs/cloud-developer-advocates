  ## Bio
    My primary professional background is rooted in Linux. I've worked at larger names in the hosting arena (Rackspace/Amazon Web Services) and have served many roles in that space such as monitoring engineer, systems engineer/architect, professional services consultant, solutions architect, devops engineer, software engineer - almost everything except for pure sales. I’ve also worked for several startups and have some background in the social media aggregation platforms and healthcare workload minded clouds (PHI, HIPAA, BAA, etc).

    When I'm not working you can find me hanging out with my family, writing music or gigging with my bands, or playing video games (StarCraft!).
