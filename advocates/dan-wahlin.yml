  ## Bio
  Dan is a web developer, architect, and Principal Cloud Developer Advocate based in Arizona. He works with AI, JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, C#, ASP.NET, Azure, Microsoft 365, Docker, Kubernetes, and several other technologies. Prior to joining Microsoft, Dan ran a consulting, training, and architecture company for 20 years called Wahlin Consulting and provided technology services to developers and corporations around the world.
  
  Dan is currently focused on helping developers build end-to-end AI and Azure solutions using JavaScript and TypeScript.
  
  When he's not staring at a computer screen, Dan enjoys hanging out with his family, getting outdoors, playing golf or basketball, and jetskiing at the one of the many lakes in Arizona (especially during the summer).
