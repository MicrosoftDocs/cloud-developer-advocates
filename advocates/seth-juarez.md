## Bio

I am a Cloud Developer Advocate and also the main host of Channel 9.

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at UNLV with a Minor in Mathematics and completed my Master's Degree at the University of Utah in the field of Computer Science. I currently am interested in Artificial Intelligence specifically in the realm of Machine Learning. These days am working on a .NET library meant to simplify the usage of the common machine learning algorithms.
