## Bio

I fell in love with coding 15 years ago. Ever since I have hacked all kinds of projects in C/C++, Delphi, C#, PHP, Java, Python, Lisp, Javascript and hoping to learn Go this year. I started my career writing Delphi for Rad Studio at Borland (or Embarcadero). While working for Corvil and Arista Networks, developed a passion for data analytics platforms and network data as well as Angular with Typescript (right before it became super popular).

Between organizing meetups at AngularJS Dublin and now Javascript London, I also enjoy mentoring at communities like Women Who Code, ngGirls and codebar. I share my excitement for Angular and Azure at conferences in Europe and the US aiming to win the hearts and minds of developers.

I currently live in London, UK where I moved to from Dublin, Ireland. Before that I spent some time in Geneva, Switzerland and most of my life in Romania - where I was born. Outside of work I am a foodie, with a preference for everything Italian.
