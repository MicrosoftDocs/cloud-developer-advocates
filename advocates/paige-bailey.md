## Bio

My education was focused on the earth sciences (geophysics, carbonate geology) and computer science (data analytics); and previous work experience was geared toward data science and plug-in development for the energy industry. Technical skills: **Python** (10 years) and **R** (4 years), with 2 years' experience building data science products using **Hadoop** and its associated dongles (especially Spark). 

When I'm not sitting in front of glowing rectangular screens at work, I absolutely adore hiking / kayaking / mountain-biking around Texas' glorious Green Belt; resuscitating Apples; and (poorly!) attempting to play bass guitar. Personal passions are sustainable energy and climate change research; STEM education reform; and empowering local governments via data science  [https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige)
