  ## Bio
  I come to Microsoft after a long career in the industry as a software developer. Initially an electrical engineer, I started coding professionally for Siemens in the 90s (in C!) and did a postgrade education in software engineering. Back then all the cool kids did Java and so I did too. Those were fun days but then I discovered .NET in 2000 and never looked back. I did it all, from WinForms to WebForms to ASP.NET. But I was always interested in design and so when Siemens sent me to Vegas at the first MIX conference in 2006, and I discovered XAML and Blend, I was sold. The next years were spent doing a lot of WPF, Silverlight (Loved it!) and all subsequent XAML-based technologies.

  I wrote Silverlight 2 Unleashed for Sams in 2008 and later Silverlight 4 Unleashed. In 2009 I also published an Model-View-Viewmodel framework called MVVM Light Toolkit which became surprisingly popular, and led me to speak about this architecture pattern and the XAML (and later Xamarin) technologies all around the world. I spoke at MIX three times (2009, 2010, 2011) which was one of the most amazing experiences of my professional life. Next to being a Windows Dev MVP from 2007 to 2017, I was also a Microsoft Regional Director since 2013 ( [https://rd.microsoft.com](https://rd.microsoft.com)) and I saw how excited this amazing group of people is about Azure. It was clear for me that this is the place to be. That's why I got really excited when I received the offer to join this team and work with a lot of friends and colleagues on promoting and teaching Azure.

  For the Cloud Advocacy team, I am active on multiple fronts. For the past few years I was the Executive Producer of a show called [Learn Live](https://aka.ms/learnlive). After about 350 shows in 2.5 years, I decided to pass the torch in July 2024 to the Microsoft Reactors team who will continue to produce the show. For me, I will concentrate in the future on a few activities:

  - Working on first party event labs such as Microsoft Build and Microsoft Ignite. Hands-on labs (both instructors-led and on-demand are very popular at our events and we are striving to offer a great experience to our attendees. This comes with challenges too, but who doesn't like a good challenge!
  - Working on the Microsoft AI Tour, a series of events worldwide around Microsoft AI, Copilot and other cool technologies we are working on.
  - Working with the Visual Studio team to promote and create content around this amazing tool that I've been using for 20 years now ([my first Visual Studio was 6.0!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio#History)).

  On the private side, I am a Harley rider and ride often with my wife Vanch in the Swiss alps, in Europe and sometimes the US. I love to garden (we have a fish pond with water lilies, toads, newts, and many fishes of many kinds), go hiking in the Swiss mountains that I call home, kayak on the lakes and rivers (we have two foldable kayaks), travel all around the world and explore. I also create a lot of content with our travel, my drone, or when riding the Harley. I publish content occasionally on my private [YouTube channel](https://gslb.ch/youtube) as well [on Flickr](https://gslb.ch/flickr) of the amazing places I am lucky to visit. I love to spend time with my family and friends. A big part of my professional activity is speaking at conferences worldwide, and I love to travel and meet, train, teach people everywhere I can.
