Michael is a teacher at heart working in Azure Engineering at Microsoft as a Cloud Ops Advocate. Coming from a career teaching at a community college in Madison, WI, his passion is for helping people learn the skills necessary to ‘skill-up’ their careers. Along with teaching, he is passionate about the IT Operations community. For the last 8 years, he has led up a global user group called The Krewe. This group provides a global network for the sharing of ideas and solutions for many in the Operations community. On a personal side, he is a huge Badger Football fan and loves hanging out with his family in Sun Prairie, WI.
