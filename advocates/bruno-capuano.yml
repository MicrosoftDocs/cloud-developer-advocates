  ## Bio
   ⚡ My name is Bruno Capuano! Sr Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. 
     

    🔭 I am a technology enthusiast. I have spoken in at least 2 different countries, so I am also an international speaker. 
     

    💬 I was a Microsoft MVP (Microsoft Most Valuable Professional) for 14 years. I was awarded in various categories, Artificial Intelligence, Windows Developer and ALM/DevOps. 
     

    🌱 In the past, I spent my time helping to connect real Business with cool technologies in Europe and North America. 
     

    👯 Because I am the father the greatest kids on the earth, I developed a passion to run (to run a lot!) 
     

    🤖 I like to make things, to challenge myself, and to improve and learn new stuff all the time.
