  ## Bio
  I've been coding for as long as I can remember, ever since my parents bought a ZX Spectrum and my Mum helped me copy listings from books and magazines. Over the last 20 years I've been coding professionally, first in C++, then moving to C# (with a little F#), on desktop then mobile using Xamarin. In recent years, I've become a Xamarin devotee, speaking about it at conferences, organising and speaking at Xamarin meetups, blogging, and writing [Xamarin in Action for Manning](http://xam.jbb.io). This passion lead to me being made a Xamarin MVP, then a Microsoft MVP.
  
  I'm excited about not only the empowerment that comes from having a supercomputer in your pocket, but with the rise in internet connectivity globally, I'm getting more and more excited about how connected apps can change our lives, be it someone in the first world ordering a take away, or someone in the third world getting an education that they otherwise would have missed out on.
  
  As well as building apps, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge, and just as happy being a teacher as a coder. I love presenting, telling stories and passing on what I've learned to others. I also really enjoy sharing what I know through writing, be it a blog post or a book.
  
  Away from technology I'm a frequent traveller, and have lived in multiple countries across 4 different continents. I'm fascinated by other cultures and enjoy trying all the different types of food the world has to offer. I'm also a devoted husband and father, and can often be found doing crafts, playing princesses or whatever my daughter is into at the time.
