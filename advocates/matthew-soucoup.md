## Bio

I love mobile and cloud development - and have been developing mobile apps with .NET since the Mono.Touch and Mono.Android days. Azure Mobile Services (back when it was called that) and Azure Storage Services were my introduction to Azure and all of it's goodness. I blog, write articles, record video courses, and speak at conferences - and when I can, illustrate them all with adorable stick figure drawings! Being from Wisconsin, I love Wisconsin craft beers and cheese of all types and garden from straw bales (just ask - I'll tell you all about it).
