## Bio

Damian is an Australian CDA specializing in DevOps. He's currently based in Toronto, Canada, but will be moving back to Australia - the land of the dangerous creatures and beautiful beaches - in 2018.

Formerly a dev at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) and a Microsoft MVP, he has a background in software development and consulting in a broad range of industries. In Australia, he co-organised the Brisbane .Net User Group, and launched the now annual [DDD Brisbane](http://dddbrisbane.com) conference. He regularly speaks at conferences, User Groups, and other events around the world, and he's been an occasional guest on various podcasts like [.NET Rocks](https://dotnetrocks.com) and [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com).

Most of the time you'll find him talking to developers and IT Pros to help them get the most out of their DevOps strategies. [https://twitter.com/damovisa](https://twitter.com/damovisa)
