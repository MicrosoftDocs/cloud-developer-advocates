  ## Bio
  I'm a seasoned technologist with over 15 years of experience, across roles in software development, computer science education, as well as active engagement as a speaker and technical community organizer. What I enjoy most about being a cloud advocate is that I'm always learning new things, it keeps my work exciting! Outside of work I enjoy gaming, playing piano, and rollerskating.
