  ## Bio
  Hi. I'm Todd, a Parnter Cloud Advocate Lead here at Microsoft.

  I've built a a career around working closely with developer communities and product teams to make software development easier and faster. Especially front-end web and mobile development. Before joining Microsoft, I was VP of Product at Progress, where I lead a global team of product engineers, product managers and developer advocates working on a wide range of software development tools and platforms, including the popular open source cross-platform mobile framework, NativeScript.
 
  And before Progress, I lead developer advocacy and product teams at Telerik for many years, working on product strategy to grow Telerikâ€™s developer tools business and launching products like web UI framework Kendo UI. During this time, I also worked closely with Microsoft as both a Visual Studio partner and as a C# MVP for five years before transitioning to focus heavily on front-end web and mobile development with JavaScript.
