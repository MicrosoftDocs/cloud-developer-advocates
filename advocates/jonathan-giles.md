## About me

I consider myself an expert on all things Java, and am a strong advocate for considered, beautiful API design. I've previously held senior roles at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp where I worked in the Java team on aspects of the Java API that has shipped in all releases since Java 7. Most recently, I was a technical lead on the JavaFX UI toolkit, responsible for UI controls, CSS engine, the scene graph, FXML, and accessibility.

In addition to this, I'm a JavaOne Rockstar speaker, a Dukes Choice award winner at JavaOne 2017 (for his open source work), a JavaOne track lead (for the user interface / user experience track, including the sessions related to JavaFX and the web), and a technical reviewer for a number of Java-related books.

I'm based in New Zealand with my wife and two children, but travel to conferences frequently to help grow the Java on Azure ecosystem. I'm a keen listener and enjoy working with the wider community to help solve their problems - either through sharing insights or returning feedback to Microsoft engineers to help improve future releases.
