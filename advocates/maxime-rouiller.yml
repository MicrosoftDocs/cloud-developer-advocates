  ## Bio
  I've been in the tech industry since the 2000s. I've always been working with .NET for as far as I can remember. I've built my profile on being a master of all trade. I've setup VMs, SharePoint environments, built servers and what not. I've coded from desktop apps to server apps, but I've truly found my passion around the web, however. Since then, I've been consulting independently for 3 years before seeing an opportunity to join Microsoft. I co-manage a local user group in Montreal, I own my own blog.

  If you want to talk bread and bicycling, I'm your man.
