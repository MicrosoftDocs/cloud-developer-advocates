  ## Bio
  Chloe is an SF based Senior Cloud Advocate for Microsoft. For the past 2 years, she has been working on educating developers on error logging and reporting tools, open source, and has been building a developer community at Sentry.io, where she created the (DevRel Award Winning) [Sentry Scouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n3GHyWTaM8) program (a camp themed meet-up ft. patches, s’mores, giant squirrel costumes, and etc). If you couldn’t pick up on the theatricality of Chloe’s meet-up, pre-engineering she was a professional musical theatre performer for over 20 years and has a BA in Theatre Performance from San Francisco State University. Perhaps the only engineer you'll meet who has been in "Hairspray", "Xanadu", "Carrie the Musical", and "Jerry Springer: the Opera"- she is passionate about bringing people with non-traditional backgrounds into the world of tech. Since her graduation from Hackbright Academy in December 2016, Chloe has worked with a wide variety of developer communities and loves to help developers’ lives easier.
  
  In 2018, Chloe was featured in the [Grace Hopper Conference gallery](https://vimeo.com/289762602/30c246c503) featuring 15 influential women in STEM by AnitaB.org. In early 2018 was named one of the "200+ Thought Leaders in Crypto and Blockchain" and still knows absolutely nothing about Crypto and Blockchain. Seriously- not a thing. She considers it her [greatest accomplishment](https://medium.com/newco/how-to-succeed-at-being-a-crypto-blockchain-influencer-without-really-trying-949327ea2d47). She is also passionate about bringing humor, empathy, and human-ness to tech. You can learn more about it in [her keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D14UpKkPtI) from DjangoCon 2018.
