  ## Bio
  I lead the JavaScript team for Microsoft Cloud Advocates.
  
  My background is in Data Science: I trained as a statistician at the University of Adelaide (Australia) and Lancaster University (UK), 
  Since 2008, I've been writing regularly about R at the [Revolutions blog](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/), and I'm a founding member of 
  the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) board of directors.
  
  In my personal time, I enjoy relaxing with my husband and our two Jack Russell terriers at home in the Napa Valley. 
  I love movies and pinball, and playing Destiny and Rock Band on the Xbox.
