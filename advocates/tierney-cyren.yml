  ## Bio
  Tierney is a member and former Chairperson of the Node.js Community Committee, and a Senior Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft.

  Tierney's interest in programming came from communities – starting with trying to build forums for games he was a part of. Over time he became more interested in the PHP-based forum systems than he was in the games he was playing, and invested more time into participating in their communities. This eventually led to Node.js and io.js, where he was able to participate and spin up the Node.js Evangelism Working Group while he was studying communications in college.

  Outside of development, Tierney enjoys gaming and fashion.
