  ## Bio

  👋 Hi! My name is Sarah Kaiser (she/her), your friendly neighborhood Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.
  
  🧪 I have spent much of my career developing new hardware in the lab, from satellites to VR to quantum computers. My house and my boat are my lab, and I experiment with microcontrollers to make them smarter.
  
  🔊 Communicating what is new and exciting about technology is my passion. I love writing, speaking and building new tools to enable the open source community to grow.

  💎 Lasers are my jam, and I am constantly finding new reasons I need to laser cut or etch everything I can get my hands on.

  🐕 When not at my split ergo keyboard, I love boating in the Puget Sound area, and playing with my dog Chewie.
