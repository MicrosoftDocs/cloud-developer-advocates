  ## Bio
  I remember when my father bought us our first computer. At the time, there weren't many personal computers in Antigua, so you could imagine how excited we were. It was a Compaq Presario that ran Windows 95 with 56k modem that woke up the house whenever you tried to get on the internet. This is the machine that I created my first "web page" on; my name in bold letters on a white background. As trivial as it sounds, at that moment I knew what I wanted to have a career in computing.

  I was originally board and raised in St. John’s, Antigua. In my career, I’ve been a teacher, podcaster, mentor and software developer. I’ve focused my skillset on building solutions with C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript and Microsoft Azure. I have a passion for software architecture, testing, and web technologies. I also co-host the 'Away from The Keyboard Podcast'. Throughout my career I've been able to continue that cycle of learning, experimenting and teaching. I think those habits are what lead me to start speaking at Code Camps and eventually making it to larger conferences. There is honestly no better feeling than seeing the lightbulb go off in someone's eyes after you've helped them learn something new or work through a problem.
