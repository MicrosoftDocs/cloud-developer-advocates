  ## Bio
  Mobile app developer, Florida Gator, World Traveler!

  I love mobile and have been creating iOS, Android and UWP Apps since joining Xamarin in 2015!

  My journey to becoming a mobile app developer started with a Computer Hardware Engineering degree from the University of Florida (Go Gators!). This is when I fell in love with writing code, albeit I was designing microprocessors not mobile apps, yet!

  My career continued to evolve, designing end-to-end satellite network architectures for Harris Corporation. It was during this period that my passions realigned as I took weekend classes and completed the Professional MBA Program at University of Florida. Go Gators, again!

  I saw mobile becoming the wave of the future, so I moved across the country to join Xamarin and be a part of the mobile revolution!

  My wife, Kim, and I love to travel any chance we get! We like to balance between relaxing on sunny beaches and hiking/exploring exciting places.

  In my free time I love running, swimming, water polo and snow skiing.
