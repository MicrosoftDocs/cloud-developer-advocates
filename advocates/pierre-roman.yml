With over 25 years of experience in the industry, Pierre brings a well-rounded view of the Ops/infra lifecycle. His experiences enable him to relate to his audiences and cultivate relationships at all levels (from the nuts and bolts guy/gal to management.) He’s a husband, a dad, a hockey fan, a gadget freak and a geek. Pierre is always ready for a conversation (in English or français - naturellement).
