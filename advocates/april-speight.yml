  ## Bio
  I've been in the tech industry for 7 years after a career in luxury fashion as a menswear stylist and visual merchandiser. I love working with bots and voice enabled devices. However, I'm currently creating new realities within the world of spatial computing!

  I like meeting new coders and people on their journey to transition into the tech industry. I provide advice and code tutorials on both my [website](https://wwww.joincomputerclub) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/vogueandcode) channel. In my spare time, you can either find me crafting or scratchin' on turntables!
