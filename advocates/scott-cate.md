## Bio

I'm a lifetime techie. I'm still doing today what I started at a very young age: copying code from people much smarter than me. Back then it was a magazine, now it's Stack Overflow. Who's with me? I have spent my career building and selling software companies ranging in size from five employees to 300+ employees. My Microsoft tech career started with an Access Database connected to a classic ASP website. Then .NET was released, and everything has been getting better day-by-day. From .NET 1.0, 1.1, 2.0â€¦.. every 3-6-12 months life added new and better ways of developing. Remember before nuget? That wasn't very long ago!

Along the way, I have always been a fan of teaching. With a motto of "Learn. Build. Share." I started and nurtured several long term local communities in Arizona. I love screen casting, and sharing "HOW DO I" videos about software. Mainly I focused on Visual Studio Tips/Tricks, but I'm excited to expand these efforts. I also love presenting on stage, the bigger the stage the happier I am. In my spare time, I love the ocean. Beaches, boating, diving, snorkeling, all of it. Family time is best spent learning new languages (I'm currently failing Spanish) and being in the sand and the water with my family!
