  ## Bio
  Aaron is a Principal Cloud Advocate in the .NET advocacy team with nearly 20 years of experience in web and .NET development.

  Passionate about open source, he actively contributes to projects like the [.NET Aspire Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire).

  In his time in the industry, Aaron has watched the evolution of web technologies—from the browser wars to modern JavaScript frameworks—while tinkering with creative ideas like implementing numbers in .NET, creating IoC in JavaScript, and coding tic-tac-toe using git commits.

  When he's not at his keyboard, Aaron can be found on running Strava, chasing his next PR, or 'improving' his smart home, much to his wifes reluctance.
