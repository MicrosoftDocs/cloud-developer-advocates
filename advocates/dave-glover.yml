  ## Bio

  I am a passionate software developer for as long as I can remember, I dream and code in C# and Python, hang out on Windows and Linux, and dabble in maker hardware.
  I have worked for Microsoft in the UK and Australia across customers, partners and the developer community.
  Over the years I have covered a broad range of technologies, from Windows and mobile, Web dev, IoT, communications, and cloud-centric computing.
  I am curious by nature, love to learn and connect with the developer community.


  When not coding, I am a proud father of 3 and live in the heart of beautiful Sydney Australia with my husband and youngest son.
  I swim to keep fit and can be bribed with ice cream.
