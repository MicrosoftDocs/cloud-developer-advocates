  ## Bio
  This is my third stint at Microsoft. My last time here, I was the Director of Product Management for Visual Studio. In between these last 10 years, I worked in exec Developer Marketing and Developer Relations roles at Amazon AWS, Facebook, and Twitter. I've also failed at numerous startups along the way. In my spare time, I'm snowboarding (always in Whistler) and at SoulCycle (I'm the Guinness World Record Holder for most spin classes in a year...seriously).
