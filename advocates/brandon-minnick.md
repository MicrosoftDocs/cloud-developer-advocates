## Bio
I love everything mobile and I share my passion with anyone willing to listen! 

As a mobile app developer working at Microsoft, I have created countless apps for iOS, Android and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). I ensure that Xamarin developers have the right tools to hit the ground running, and running in the right direction, when creating their apps. 

When speaking with developers, it is important to understand their technical requirements, but also their business requirements, and I leverage my entrepreneurial background and my MBA to have conversations with all levels, from developers to CEOs.

I currently have apps in the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store and Windows Store. Search any store for "Brandon Minnick" to discover them. They're free; download today! 

I am also active in the C# developer community! Follow me on Twitter and GitHub!
