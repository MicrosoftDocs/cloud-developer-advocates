  ## Bio
  Iâ€™m a startup advocate for Azure working in London, United Kingdom. I joined Microsoft via the acquisition of SwiftKey. I've been working with the public cloud since 2008 and have led multiple cloud migrations.

  I've worked in leadership roles in both large companies and startups, alongside mentoring / advising / investing in startups. I hail originally from New Zealand which is where I gained my PhD in Computer Science.

  Over the years I've been involved in a wide range of open source activities, including contributions to the Linux kernel and being president of a Linux Users Group.
  
  I have high functioning autism (Aspergers) and sometimes I consider this a disability, but most of the time it's a super power.

  ## Skills
  * Open source  
  * Scalability and performance
  * DevOps / Infrastructure as Code
  * Leadership
  * Diversity and Inclusion
