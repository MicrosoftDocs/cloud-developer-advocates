He's been programming since he was 10, starting on a TI-99 4A. His broad background includes roles as a DBA, Developer, CIO, and nearly everything in-between. Brian built his first custom Linux distribution in 2007, which was used by colleges and companies like IBM to make developing with Ruby on Rails easier.
